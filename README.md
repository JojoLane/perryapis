## Automated Test for PerryApis

**Note: Ideally these tests would be hosted on Jenkins and be automically run when changes were committed to PerryApi.**
*In this instance the tests will need to be manually commenced.*

* Step 1:
Checkout the code

* Step 2: 
Add the code to your IDE.

* Step 3:  
Right click and "run" on TestSuite1

* Step 4:
Await and view results and Test Report that is produced

**Test Overview:**
*I created a number of tests that hit each of the different endpoints in the API, checked for the correct response and behaviour per REST guidelines. I found a number 
bugs/questionable behaviour of which I have reported below:*
